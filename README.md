# Age-and-Gender-Detection

This project is designed to perform both classification and regression to predict both gender and age respectively from facial images. The system leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and make accurate predictions.

## Key Features

- **Age Prediction**: The system uses regression to predict the age of an individual based on their facial features.
- **Gender Classification**: The system uses classification to determine the gender of an individual based on their facial features.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: The project employs a deep learning architecture to analyze facial features and make predictions.
- **Facial Image Analysis**: The system is capable of analyzing facial images to extract relevant features for age and gender prediction.

## Importance

- **Applications in Surveillance**: This system can be used in surveillance systems to identify individuals based on their age and gender.
- **Applications in Healthcare**: The system can be used in healthcare to analyze facial features for age-related diseases or conditions.
- **Applications in Marketing**: The system can be used in marketing to target specific demographics based on age and gender.

## Technical Details

- **Dataset**: The project uses the UTKFace dataset, which contains a large collection of facial images with age and gender labels.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: The project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the deep learning models.
- **Model Architecture**: The project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to analyze facial features.
- **Preprocessing**: The system uses data augmentation and normalization techniques to preprocess the facial images.
- **Training**: The system uses a combination of cross-entropy loss and mean squared error to train the models.
